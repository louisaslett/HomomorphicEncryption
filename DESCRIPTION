Description: A reference implementation of homomorphic encryption schemes.
    These are encryption schemes which allow limited operations (such as
    addition and multiplication) to be performed on the cipher text directly
    without decrypting first.  In other words, if you encrypt the values 2 and 3
    and "add" their cipher texts then decrypting renders 5.
